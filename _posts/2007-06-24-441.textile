I'm pretty sure today's run ties for my longest long run ever, at nine miles.  That's the longest I ever made it during my last attempt at training for a marathon.  I did start a 12-miler back then, but couldn't finish, probably because I hadn't done a good job at getting in all my training runs.  I may have done longer back in high school during cross country or track, but I don't remember.  Anyways, it was a nice evening run, which I've named the "golf run" because it goes by a golf course.  Really creative, huh?
