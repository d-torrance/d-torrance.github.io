title: college football poll - week 14
---
Here it is, the final regular season poll!  Sadly, no new poll until after the MNC game.  Although, I do have a basketball poll in the works!
<p/>
So basically, the Bearcats got robbed.  They're no longer #1 -- 'Bama's win over the Overrators (like that?) was enough to move the Tide back to numero uno -- but in my poll they're a very solid number two.
