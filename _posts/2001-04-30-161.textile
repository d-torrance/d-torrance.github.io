I disagree with that dude's statement that "the slower progress into space is because space flight is immensely more difficult than simple airplane flights."  Come on, twelve years after Sputnik we had a man on the moon!  I believe the sole reason progress in space is lacking is the fall of communism. If the Cold War were still going on, we'd probably be on Mars or mining the asteroid belt right now.  It was all about beating the Ruskies.
