<b>day 4</b> - yellowstone national park. i didn't realize how big this place was. after i paid my admission fee, i had to drive another 60 miles (a good chunk of it through construction) to my campsite, which was still only about halfway through the park! on the way, i passed these bision chilling out and took a pic from my car.
