So far this week has been nearly identical to last.  3-miler on Tuesday, 5-miler on Wednesday, and I'll be doing another 3-miler on Thursday.  I've mentioned it briefly, but I haven't really gone into my training program.  I'm using <a href="http://www.halhigdon.com/marathon/inter1.html">Hal Higdon</a>'s training schedule.  So far I've kept to it on the nose, something that I failed to do the first time I was training for a marathon.  When I was training for Cincinnati, I was skipping sessions right and left, basically setting myself up for failure.  It was tough, trying to work in retail and train.  It's been so much easier so far.  I'm only on campus a few hours a day and have my entire weekends free.  Things might get a little crazier once August rolls around and classes start back up, but I'm hoping at that point getting up at 6 to run a bunch of miles will have become as routine as brushing my teeth.
