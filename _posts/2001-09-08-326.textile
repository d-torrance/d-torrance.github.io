Whoo!  Northwestern is 1-0 after defeating UNLV 37-28.  The next game, in Evanston against Navy, will be extra special cause I'll be there.  Yay season tickets.<br>
Song stuck in my head while I was painting today (although I wasn't actually working, just painting actual stuff at my house):  Ben Folds - Rocking the Suburbs<br>
And, ironically, MP3 of the day:  Ben Folds - Rocking the Suburbs
