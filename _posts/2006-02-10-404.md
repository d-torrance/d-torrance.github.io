So my computer has slowly morphed over time from the original Gateway that I bought six and a half years ago before I started my freshman year of college. Up until today, four parts remained the same: my floppy drive, my LAN card, my speakers, and my monitor. Well, knock that number down to three. As an early birthday present, I treated myself to a new <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16824021034">19 inch LCD monitor</a>. It's oh so amazing.
