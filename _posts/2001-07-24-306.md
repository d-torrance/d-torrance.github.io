I finished <i>A Brave New World</i> last night. Tight book. My quote of the day is:

<div class="quote">
<i>    "But I don't want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin."<br>
    "In fact," said Mustapha Mond, "you're claiming the right to be unhappy."<br>
    "All right then," said the Savage defiantly, "I'm claiming the right to be unhappy."</i>
