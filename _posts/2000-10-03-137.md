So I'm operating my computer today. I decide I'd like to burn a CD (Mandrake Linux 7.1 - I've always been a RedHat person, but RedHat 7.0 <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/00/10/02/2046212.shtml">![]($#@%)\#$!@ sucks</a> and won't install on my system, so I decided to switch distros for a change). But anyways, back to the original story. I decide I'd like to burn a CD. And I see <a href="screen.jpg">this</a>. I have TWO CD DRIVES. TWO. NOT ZERO. Of course it was easily fixed with a reboot, but pretty darn obnoxious. Ok, end of story.
