Saw <i>Planet of the Apes</i> tonight.  Pretty pimp remake.  Didn't come close to the original of course.  But I liked it.  You know the weird part about it?  That overplayed line in all the previews that has General Thade saying, "Get the Spaceman!"  I don't recall actually hearing it in the movie!  I'm probably just dumb though.<br>
