Check out these uber CSS navigation tabs in the upper right hand corner. Took some rather sloppy PHP coding to finally get them to work right, but it looks pimp, right? For now, they don't actually go anywhere special. Props to <a href="http://nontroppo.org/test/tab1.html">this site</a> from where I ripped off the CSS code that made this possible.
