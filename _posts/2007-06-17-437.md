title: baby needs a new pair of shoes
---

So I took a little day trip to Spokane today. The primary purpose was to replace my aging Nikes, and <a href="http://www.runnersoul.com/spokane/">Runners Soul</a> is the only running specialty store I'm aware of in the area. So I waltzed out of there with a shiny new pair of <a href="http://www.brooksrunning.com/prod.php?p=BSI41205">Brooks Adrenaline GTS 7</a>'s. Rather than turning my tail and heading back to the Palouse, I decided to give running in Spokane a go, since that's my ultimate goal and all. So I checked out the <a href="http://www.spokanecentennialtrail.org/">Spokane River Centennial Trail</a>. After aimlessly running around about a million other bike trails in Spokane's <a href="http://www.spokaneriverfrontpark.com/">Riverfront Park</a> for 15 min, I finally found the Centennial Trail and continued onward, for a total of a 50 min run. It took me through Gonzaga's campus, and I got to see some great views of the river. Usually you think of rivers going through cities as being pretty calm, but Spokane River has rapids and waterfalls and whatnot. It's pretty cool. No idea how far the run was, but I'd wager between 5 and 6 miles. The new shoes felt great.
