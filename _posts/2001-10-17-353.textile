So I'm walking to my Real Analysis class at Tech today after totally kicking the ass of my Fundamentals of Anthropology midterm and almost get clotheslined by this dude riding a bike with crutches lashed to his back.  Horizontally, I might add, so as to maximize possible clotheslinage.  This brings to mind a question.  If someone has crutches, chances are that they're currently suffering from a leg/foot injury which would hamper their mobility by impeding their ability to walk.  And pedal.  WTF was he doing with those crutches???<br>
On a brighter note, my Aeroplane Flies High boxed set I ordered on Ebay arrived today.  So now I finally own every major Smashing Pumpkins release.  Yay.<br>
MP3 of the day:  The Smashing Pumpkins - The Last Song
