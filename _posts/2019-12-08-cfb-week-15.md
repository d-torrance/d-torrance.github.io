The Bayou Bengals leapfrog the Buckeyes to regain the #1 spot.  The
way the formula works, beating Georgia for the SEC crown helped LSU
since they didn't have a direct win over them yet, but a comeback win
against Wisconsin in Indy did absolutely nothing for OSU since they'd
already beaten the Badgers earlier in the season.
