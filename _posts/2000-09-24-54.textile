Yeah, I know I haven't updated in a while.  I'm back at school now.  I'm busy.  Deal with it.  I had my 2nd conversation with God--er, Larry Combs today.  I met him originally almost a year ago when I went to his recital down at DePaul University.  It turns out his father also used to take him to Ohio State games when he was a tyke.  Do you know what this means?  I SHARE SOMETHING IN COMMON WITH LARRY COMBS!!
