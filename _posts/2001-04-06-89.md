Normally when I eat breakfast at Plex, they play all this R&B or smooth jazz nonsense. But today I walked in and they were playing some U2 and David Bowie. I was eating my pancakes and tapping my toe in glee. But, all of a sudden, it stopped. Fifteen seconds later, the smooth jazz commenced. Damn you,APlex Music Person.
