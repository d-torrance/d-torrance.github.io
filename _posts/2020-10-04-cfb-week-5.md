Neither Louisiana nor Miami played this week, but their previous
victims did well enough for them to tie for first.  Meanwhile, Georgia
is the first SEC team to crack the top 10 with their win over Auburn
(not to mention, their previous opponent Arksansas's win over
Mississippi State the week after that team Air Raided all over LSU).
