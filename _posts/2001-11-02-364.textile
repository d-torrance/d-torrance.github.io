Since it's November now, I might as well close the Ghostbusters poll.  Final results:  7 fans of Vigo from <i>Ghostbusters II</i>, 4 preferred Gozer aka "Prehistoric Bitch" from <i>Ghostbusters</i>, 2 liked the Boogeyman from the cartoon, and apparently I'm the only intelligent one, since Samhain only got one vote.  C'mon guys!  This poll was up during October!  Why didn't you vote for the spirit of Halloween??  New poll will be up as soon as I'm in a creative mood.
