Yesterday, a dark wizard put an Imperius curse on me, forcing me to read <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i> all day rather than run. So my scheduled 6-mile "race pace" run never occurred. Oh well, it was a "stepback" week anyway. However, the curse wore off today, as I went out and did my 9-mile long run.
