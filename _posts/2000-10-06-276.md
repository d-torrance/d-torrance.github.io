Tales of a math major: So I spend a good deal of time busting my butt trying to figure out how on Earth this poor goose from my differential equations book is supposed to get back to his nest with this horrendous southeast wind blowing against his face. (Do geese even have faces?) Upon returning to the problem later in the evening, I realize that southeast is totally not where I thought it was. For a good part of today, I'd been prancing around calling something "southeast" when most people would have said "southwest."
