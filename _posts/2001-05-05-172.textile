Alas, no Pat Day victory at the Kentucky Derby.  I've had this obsession with Pat Day since I was about 7.  Every single year, I've rooted for the horse that he jockeys (is that a verb?).  I don't know why, he just seemed like such a cool guy whenever the ABC Sports people interviewed him.  And the winningest jockey of all time at Churchill Downs, so he's no slouch.  But Monarchos won, not Dollar Bill.  Oh well.
