title: college football poll - week 2
---

Woot, it's college football season again! Time for some graph theory meets anthropology computer poll action. Again, early in the season, this doesn't tell us much as the graph is disconnected. But still kind of fun. Plus, my 'Cats are in the \#12 spot. (I believe they are the only team in the country to have two wins over BCS schools. So what if they're both 0-2.)
