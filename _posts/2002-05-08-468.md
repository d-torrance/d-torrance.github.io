I figured I'd update instead of actually doing something like get some sleep the night before my History of Ancient Egypt midterm... So I'm going to rave about Smallville. My two favorite television shows used to be the Fox Sunday night combo of Simpsons and X-Files, both of which are still on the air... but suck as of late. This year I've been enjoying the hell out of Smallville, in spite of the tired high-school-kid-gets-powers-from-kryptonite plot they tend to recycle. Tonight's was especially awesome. At least the villain's powers weren't specifically attributed to kryptonite (or "meteor rocks" as they're currently called) and his role in the show was much more than as some dude for Clark to beat up in the end. He was getting with Chloe, who Clark just decided to try and hook up with, causing some jealousy, which confuses the hell out of Lana, who's obviously getting kind of sick of Whitney and looks now like she has eyes for Clark. So it's switched 180 degrees from the beginning of the season, when the love triangle looked like Chloe-~~<span style="text-align:right;">Clark-</span>~~&gt;Lana. Now it's Lana-~~<span style="text-align:right;">Clark&lt;-</span>~~&gt;Chloe. But Whitney's dad just died, and it looked that Lana was just about to break up with him, but he broke the sad news first. So she can't dump him now! What's gonna happen?![](?) Obviously in the end we know Clark and Lana get together. That's how the Superman mythos goes. Clark Kent's high school sweetheart was Lana Lang. Case closed. The goal of Chloe's character always seemed to be as a means of getting Clark interested in journalism, not as a love interest. So we'll see.
