title: college football poll - week 6
---

BYU comes in at #1, likely because as an independent, their opponents
have come from multiple conferences.  This gives them a larger pool of
teams to possibly have "wins" against.  Since many teams are playing
conference-only schedules due to the coronavirus, this is a rarity.

Meanwhile, the SEC is climbing higher with the Tide and Dawgs reaching a
tie for #5.  They play each other next week, so it will be interesting
to see how the next poll shakes out.
