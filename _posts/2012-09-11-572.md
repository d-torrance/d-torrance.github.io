title: XDG menus in WindowMaker
---

For some reason, this took me forever to figure out, so I'm posting it here.

<p/>
Let's say that you, like me, are an avid Ubuntu user who refuses to be dragged kicking and screaming into Unity-land, instead choosing to go completely old-school and run WindowMaker. However, you want a nice application menu. Here's what you can do:

<p/>
Grab the "xdg\_menu" perl script from <a href="http://archlinux-stuff.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/xdg-menu/xdg_menu">here</a>.

<p/>
Run the following code (in the directory you downloaded the file):

<p/>
    chmod +x xdg_menu
    sudo cp xdg_menu /usr/local/bin
    sudo apt-get install libxml-parser-perl

<p/>
Next, open up WindowMaker Preferences, scroll over to the menu-editing screen, and drag a "Generated Submenu" bar over to your menu and rename it whatever you want by double clicking on it. In the "Command" field, enter "xdg\_menu". Save and you're all set.
