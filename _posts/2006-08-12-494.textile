my new home. my alex ross flash poster has adorned the space above my bed in every room i've slept in since freshman year at nu, so of course it got the place of honor yet again! to the left of where i'm standing when taking this shot is my tiny little kitchenette. aside from the bathroom behind me, that's pretty much all there is to it.
