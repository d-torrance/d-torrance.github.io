title: college football poll - bowl edition
---

Things are finally (kind of) looking normal after bowl season.  Our
graph is finally connected!  The Crimson Tide vault to a commanding
lead before next week's champsionship game, and their scarlet and gray
opponents jump to #6.  (If the Buckeyes can pull of a win, will they
end up in #1?  I think there's a decent chance -- they'd inherit a
bunch of SEC "wins" from 'Bama.)
