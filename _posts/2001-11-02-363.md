Has anyone ever noticed how much people swing their arms when they walk? As I was walking back from Regenstein this morning, I was experimenting with how I swing my own arms. The forward arms is always on the opposite side of the forward leg. If I make them be on the same side, I kind of wobble back and forth when I walk. And if I swing my arms in unison, so that both arms are forward at the same time, I can walk halfway normally, it just feels really weird.
