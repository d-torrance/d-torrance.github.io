You know what sucks about summer if you're all big into comic books like me? Goddamn crossovers. You know how much money I've freaking spent following this Our Worlds at War thing DC Comics is doing right now? Gah. Oh well. It's mad pimp, and I have a job, so I'll stop bitching. Speaking of Our Worlds at War, here's the quote of the day: <i>"Flee or die! Bearskin wedgies for everyone!"</i> - Barbara Gordon, <i>Nightwing: Our Worlds at War</i> \#1

Speaking of comics, the lady that played Lana Lang in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0086393">Superman III</a> is playing Martha Kent in the upcoming <a href="http://www.comicscontinuum.com:81/stories/0107/11/index.htm">Smallville</a> tv series. Is that freaking cool or what?
