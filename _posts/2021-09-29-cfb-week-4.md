title: college football poll - week 4
---

A little delay this season as I had to make some tweaks to the
[code](https://github.com/d-torrance/cfb-cor).  In particular,
[https://collegefootballdata.com/](https://collegefootballdata.com/)
switched to requiring a (free) API key, which broke
[CFBScrapy](https://github.com/rlindholm/CFBScrapy).  So I switched to the
official Python interface, [cfbd](https://github.com/CFBD/cfbd-python).

But it's working now, so a-polling we will go!
