<b>day 2</b> - i stopped at the university of iowa (ironically, the 2nd of 3 "u of i"s i would be stopping at) to eat breakfast, seeing as i-80 goes right through iowa city. this shot is of this crazy cool steeple in their med school area. i tried to get a closer look at the building, but as far as i could tell, it was completely surrounded by other buildings! i think i wasted a good hour walking in circles around this area.
