<a href="http://www.theforce.net/episode2/storyline/Episode_II_Scriptment.shtml">Wow</a>. If Episode II is half as cool as this, I'll be pretty damn happy. (And it should be, considering this is supposedly based on reliable information, whatever that is...) Looks like we'll see some character growth in Anakin and Amidala. I just hope Obi Wan isn't a freaking tool like he was in TPM... But regardless, Yoda kicking some ass will be all worth it.
