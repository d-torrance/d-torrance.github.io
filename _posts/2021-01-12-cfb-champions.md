title: college football poll - championship edition
---

After trouncing the Buckeyes last night, Alabama pulls into a
commanding lead to finish with its fourth friedcheese.org national
championship.  They previously won in 2009 (the first year of the
poll!), 2015, and 2016, although the latter two are retroactive (i.e.,
I wasn't actively updating the poll during those seasons.)

Not surprisingly, 32.3203125 "wins" is the lowest total for a champion
yet, given that so few games were played this year in comparison to a
season not taking place during a global pandemic...  The next closest
is Florida State's 39.34375 "wins" in 2014.
