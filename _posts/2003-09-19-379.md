Sad news. My old Spanish 3 webpage from sophomore year of high school has finally been deleted by the Geocities/Yahoo powers that be. RIP <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/2116/">La Clase de EspaÃ±ol</a>. My old <a href="http://www.geocities.com/ap_chem/">AP Chem</a> page from junior year, however, lives on.

<a href="http://www.mysticalball.com/">Nifty little math trick</a>. Here's how it works. You choose a two-digit number, which we can write as 10x+y. You add the two digits, aka x+y, and subtract that from our original number, aka 10x+y-(x+y)=9x. As you can see, all multiples of 9 up to 81 have the same symbol.
