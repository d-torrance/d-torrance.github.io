Tim Hortons of four years ago:  My dad and I would always go to Tim Hortons after our piano lessons, where we were greeted by friendly service and a wide selection of yummy food.<br>
Tim Hortons of today:  My dad and I went to Tim Hortons after our piano lesson, where no one was out front.  My dad had to peek into the kitchen five minutes into our wait and alert them that we wanted to buy stuff.  My dad ordered chicken stew, which they were currently out of.  However, the cashier was unaware of this and ended up taking our money anyway.  Several minutes later, her manager alerted her of the chicken stew situation, and it seemed to take some time for the predicament to process in her brain.  Finally, we were officially informed of the problem, and my dad actually had to request for our money to be given back.  He finally got chicken noodle soup instead.  As has been the case in recent visits, they forget to give us rolls with our soup without our request.  And my dad's water tasted funny.<br>
My donut was yummy.
