title: college football poll - week 9

Ohio State and Florida swap places as the Buckeyes beat Penn State and the Gators fall to Georgia.

<p/>
An interesting phenomenon this season is the abundance of Pac-12 teams with medicore records in the top 25. Let's take a closer look.

<p/>
Stanford comes in at \#8, just three spots behind national title contender Oregon. They have quality out-of-conference wins against San Jose State (giving them lots of WAC "wins") and Duke (giving them lots of ACC "wins"), and of course they beat USC and Arizona. They also beat Cal, who beat UCLA, who beat Nebraska, giving them lots of distant Big Ten "wins".

<p/>
Oregon State, who was just handed their first loss last night against Washington, is no real surprise at \#10. However, just three spots later, we have Arizona with three losses. They have wins over solid Toledo and Oklahoma State teams, giving them lots of "wins" in the MAC and Big 12. And their three losses happen to be the aforementioned Stanford and the two Oregon schools.

<p/>
USC sits at 6-2 and \#20. Nothing really very odd there.

<p/>
Finally, the real head scratcher. The Huskies sitting at .500 landed in \#21. They have a quality out-of-conference win against San Diego State, giving them lots of MWC "wins". Their two conference wins include none other than Stanford and Oregon State, and their four losses are against some pretty great teams: LSU, Oregon, USC, and Arizona.
