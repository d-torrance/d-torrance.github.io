title: college football poll - week 5
---
The Beavers continue their rise despite having two less wins than most of the rest of the country (thanks to Hurricane Isaac forcing the postponement of their game against Nicholls State during week one and a bye in week three), this time all the way to the top spot after a win against Arizona.<p/>

Alas, despite being 5-0, Northwestern has yet to reappear in the rankings, as all of its fallen opponents are pretty freakin' dreadful.<p/>
