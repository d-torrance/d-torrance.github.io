It's Wednesday! That means it's time for comic book reviews!!

<ul>
<li>
<i>JSA Classified</i> \#9. Jay Garrick is forced to kill a man to save the JSA! Now that's a wacky good comic book story. Don Kramer's art is perfect for this title, although I don't think Champagne's inks quite did him justice this issue.

</li>
<li>
<i>Action Comics</i> \#836. The Krypton of Earth-2's universe, John Byrne's Krypton, and Mark Waid's Krypton side-by-side? Superman names himself, not Lois? Supes and Batman blackmail Luthor? Doomsday doesn't really live up to his name? Dr. Light is sent to the Phantom Zone? Jimmy Olsen in a purple leotard? OMGWTF. <i>Adventures</i> \#649 better have some answers next week or my head will explode.

</li>
<li>
<i>Justice</i> \#4. Quite frankly, if this comic book was nothing but Lex Luthor and Sinestro trading pie recipes, I'd still buy it just to drool over the Alex Ross art. Basically, the entire issue is just one big cliffhanger. Lex and friends have taken over, and our favorite heroes are all royally screwed one way or another. Definitely has me waiting to see what'll happen next.

</li>
</ul>
All in all, a great week. Keep it up, DC!
