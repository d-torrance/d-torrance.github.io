Now that the summer session is at its close, I'll be traveling to Ohio for a week.  That won't stop my training, though!  I have a 7-miler I need to get out of the way early tomorrow morning before I drive to the airport, and Sunday is a planned 15-miler.  I've figured out a little 3-mile route that goes around my old high school and middle school, which I'll tack on the beginning of an out-and-back 12-miler on the Heritage Rail Trail, where I did most of my long runs when I was first attempting to train for a marathon last year.
