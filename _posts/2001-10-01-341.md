Signalling the beginning of a new month, I have a new poll. And a new image, which actually relates to the poll, whoo! (Guess who I voted for?) In regards to the previous poll, Quinn won with 3 votes, and Stacy came in second with 2. No one wanted to do Sandi or Tiffany--and I don't blame them. Personally I voted for Stacy. I always saw her as the oddball of the Fashion Club. She definitely seemed like the least prissy and full of herself. Actually, just the opposite--she's actually quite insecure about herself. And she has a cute, bubbly personality that I always found neat. Although if the three of you that voted for Quinn voted so that you could use Quinn to get to Daria to get to Jane, I don't blame you.<br>
Ok, I'll shut up now.
