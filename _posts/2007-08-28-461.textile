title: let's pretend that week didn't happen...
---
So I didn't run last week.  At all.  I wasn't injured or anything.  It was the first week of classes, and I guess I was just adjusting to the new schedule of having to actually be on campus for more than a couple hours each day.  It's a shame because it was the "peak" week of the last cycle of weeks, the current week being a stepback week.  I hope that doesn't come back to bite me too much.  So far so good this week, at least.  This morning was a 5-miler, which I did at a pretty quick pace - my fastest 5 miles thus far this year.  It's fun seeing more runners out now that more people are back in town.  I actually saw a couple guys running the other direction through the sheep farm!
