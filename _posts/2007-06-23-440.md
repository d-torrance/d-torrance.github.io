Wow, that was a great run. I'm really starting to like this rest-on-Fridays thing. It makes me feel so refreshed for my Saturday runs. Today was another 5 mile run. This time, I took a different route than I've done before. It's a modified version of a 7-miler I did a few weeks back. Most of the second mile goes through a big sheep farm belonging to the university, so I call it the "sheep run". The last couple miles wound around through campus, and I got some pretty good hill work out of it. I felt fantastic!
