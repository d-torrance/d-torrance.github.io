The friedcheese.org College Football Poll returns!!!1!!

So beginning in the 2013 season, the NCAA took down their .csv file
containing the scores of all their games.  And when I bugged them about it,
they even acted like no such thing had ever existed!  From their response:

"At this time there are no plans to make bulk downloads of scores available
to the general public.  You can access all scores from our scoreboard
pages or from team pages that are available for all teams."

So that's what I did.  Well, five years later...

My old script was in Perl.  I've been playing around with Python recently,
so the new one is in Python.  It uses BeautifulSoup to scrape the NCAA's
scoreboard pages and NetworkX for the graph theory stuff.  You can find
the source code at [https://github.com/d-torrance/cfb-cor].
