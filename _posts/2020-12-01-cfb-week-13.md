title: college football poll - week 13
---

Thanks to COVID, a last-minute Colorado v. SDSU game was played on
Saturday, merging the Pac-12 component of the graph in with the
mega-component occupied the ACC, Big 12, and friends.  The Buffs' win
was good enough for them to become the first Pac-12 team to break into
the Top 25, to boot.

Not much change at the top, as #1 - 8 remain the same as last week.
