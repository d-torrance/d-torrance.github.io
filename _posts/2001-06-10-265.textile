Well, I'm home.  Two-ply toilet paper is the true meaning of existence.  Saw <i>Moulin Rouge</i> tonight.  Pimp-ass movie.  Various reasons include:
<ul>
<li>Nicole Kidman is hot.
<li>It was so freaking creative musically.
<li>Nicole Kidman is hot.
<li>It was so freaking creative visually.
<li>Nicole Kidman is hot.
<li>Ewan McGregor is also Obi-Wan.

</ul>
Seriously though, it was pimp.  If I hadn't already seen <i>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</i> this year, it'd most definitely get the esteemed title Pimpest Movie Doug Has Seen Yet In 2001.  It's such a different kind of pimp...  Maybe they'll share the title.  Speaking of pimp, George has agreed to host friedcheese.org for the summer.  Yay!
