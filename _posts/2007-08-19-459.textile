Maybe it was the time change.  Maybe it was the "my parents are buying everything, who cares what I eat" diet.  Maybe it was the fact that I ran a 5K really hard without having done any speedwork since early spring.  (I did get a adult PR of 22:43, although still well shy of my overall PR of 19:20 at age 16.)  But towards the end of last week's Ohio trip, I self-destructed.  My 7-miler on Saturday turned into a 4-miler.  My 11-miler on Sunday turned into a ... 1-miler.  2, I guess, if you count the shameful walk back to the car.  Anyways, it continued this week, as I lazily skipped my Tuesday and Thursday runs, and walked the last 2 of Wednesday's 8-miler.  Finally, this morning I had a great run, running 8 miles.  It called for "race pace" again, although I averaged about 9:30 instead of my usual 9.  But who cares, it felt great to get out there and actually finish a run for the first time in over a week.  Some of my morning runs earlier this summer were really chilly as I started, running to the west into the wind, and really warm as I finished, running back east into the sun.  Today was the opposite, as I ran east first.  I guess the return of that chilly wind means that fall is right around the corner.  The fact that classes start back up on Monday is probably even more of an indication...
