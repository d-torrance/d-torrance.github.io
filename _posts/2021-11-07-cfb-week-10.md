title: college football poll - week 10
---

Shockingly, Notre Dame's win over 2-7 Navy is enough to vault them over the
Georgia Bulldogs.  I think one disadvantage of the coefficient of relationship
algorithm the poll uses is that it rewards independents who play teams from
lots of different conferences and thus have shorter "win" paths to more teams
than teams that have only a small non-conference schedule.

Meanwhile, still-unbeaten Cincinnati and UTSA bump Michigan down to #5, but the
Wolverines are still ahead of also-unbeaten Oklahoma.
