I bought new running shorts yesterday, which I christened today on my traditional Washington-and-back 3 miler. Now I'm officially wearing nothing but high-tech designed-for-running gear. Yay. It was a nice run, although already ridiculously hot for 8 in the morning. Good ol' July. On a totally unrelated note, with today's release of the new Transformers movie, I had the perfect idea for next summer's big budget, CGI-filled, based-on-an-80s-toy-franchise action thriller - Care Bears! I even whipped up some conceptual art for <a href="images/funshine.jpg">Funshine Bear</a>.
