title: college football poll - week 10
---

Notre Dame stays on top after surviving a close game against my Northwestern Wildcats.  Not surprisingly, 'Bama leapfrogs the Clemson and LSU Tigers after shutting out the latter.

UCF breaks into the top 10, as does ... South Carolina?  The presence of the 3-loss Gamecocks is a little puzzling.  But those losses came from Georgia, Kentucky, and Texas A&M, all teams which appear elsewhere in the poll.
