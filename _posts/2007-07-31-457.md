After over two weeks of laziness, I finally forewent the snooze button on my alarm clock (okay, I might have hit it once...) and went for a morning run. As much as I love getting my run out of the way early and having the rest of my day ahead of me, there's one thing that I definitely prefer about evening runs, especially this time of year: it gradually gets cooler during the run. Morning runs are exactly the opposite. Bleh.
