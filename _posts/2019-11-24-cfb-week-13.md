title: college football poll - week 13
---

The Bearcats jump 2 places to move into the #3 spot, as Clemson had a
bye and Penn State lost to the #2 Buckeyes.  No change in the top 2,
but OSU is closing in on LSU, with only a quarter of a virtual win
separating them.  Could a win over #6 Michigan next weekend move them
into #1?
