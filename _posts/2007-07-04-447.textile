To commemorate our nation's independence, I ran six miles in ninety-degree weather.  Normally, I like to run in the morning or the evening when the sun isn't so high up in the sky.  However, today, being a holiday, resulted in my lazy grad student butt sleeping in past prime morning run hours.  Also, again since today is a holiday, I plan on spending my evening in Pullman watching purty fireworks, again during prime evening run hours.  Conundrum.  So I sucked it up and ran in the afternoon.  It was super hot, but a really good run.  I tried out a new 6-mile route, this one going back behind the Kibbie Dome on this awesome hill and also incorporating part of my sheep run route.  I love those sheep!  There's like four or five little mini-herds of them, each with their little fenced-in area with a feeding trough, shelter, and whatnot.  Almost every time I run past them, the last little mini-herd is <i>always</i> eating!  I think they're my favorite.
