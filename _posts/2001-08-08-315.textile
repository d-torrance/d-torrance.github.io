I'm still not really in a blogging mood, but I figured I owe my readers (all two of you) an occasional update.  I went camping this past weekend.  First time since I quit Scouts back in the day.  It was mad pimp.  Nature is amazing.  I think that had a direct effect on why I'm still not really in a blogging mood.<br>
MP3 of the day:  The Beatles - Carry That Weight
