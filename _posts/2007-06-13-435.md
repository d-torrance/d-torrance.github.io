Today I went for a five-miler. Not having done specifically that quantity as a Moscow resident (I've done plenty of 4- and 6-milers, but never 5 for some reason), I had to figure out a new route. Granted, I could always just do an out-and-back on a 2.5 mile stretch of one of the bike paths, but I like to actually run on roads and see the town every once in a while. Not to mention that the bike paths are very flat, and I like to get a few hills in. The Spokane race is supposed to have a whole slew of them. A good source for routes is the <a href="http://www.palouseroadrunners.org/">Palouse Road Runners</a> website. I chose the "Up Town" 4.7 mile route (connecting to it from my apartment brought it up to 5). It was a nice run, mostly through the residential parts of town. I messed up a little bit, cutting down to 1st street too early instead of staying on D, but mile-wise it was six of one, half-dozen of the other. I might've missed a good hill or something, shrug. My shoes are starting to bother me a bit. I'm planning on driving up to Spokane this weekend to gear up.
