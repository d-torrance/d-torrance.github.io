Hi everybody!  Jen said a couple days ago when I was helping her make her webpage that I should make one too.  Sure, I do have a webpage already, but now it's just calculator games and Flash information.  I used to have a personal homepage, back in the day at Geocities.  But I'm gonna bring it back.  And if you're wondering about the color scheme, I've used the same body tag on my webpage for like five years now.  Wow.  I've grown to love the bgcolor="#00000" text="#ff0000", etc.  Yep.  Here's a link to <a href="http://members.aol.com/~jennyjens">Jen's</a> webpage.  And also check <a href="http://www.geocities.com/ap_chem/">this</a> out.  An old friend from high school sent me the link the other day.  It's our final project from AP Chemistry.  I slaved over this thing for a couple weeks two periods a day.  Read the Colligative Properties section very carefully.  Notice how well I integrated the Symbol font with the surrounding material.  Yep.  Good ol' AP Chem.

Well, I'm leaving for home tonight.  Wee!  Go Spring Break!  I'm kinda bummed cause I won't be able to mess with Linux for a week and a half.  Oh well.  It's Spring Break, I get to sleep in.  Sleeping in far outweighs messing with Linux.

I suppose I should link to the other sections of this site, just in case people wanting to visit them get lost.

Oh, my name's Doug by the way.  :)
