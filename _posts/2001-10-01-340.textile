Holy crap, it's October.  I've spent the last few hours reading <i>The Selfish Gene</i> by Richard Dawkins for my anthropology class.  Now I have this urge to go out and have massive amounts of sex so my genes will live on.<br>
I made eggplant parmesan for dinner tonight.  And then a pecan pie.  Cooking kicks ass.
