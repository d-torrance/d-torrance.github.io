title: college football poll - week 9
---

Michigan State's comeback win against their in-state rivals isn't quite
enough to rank them higher than the Wolverines, but it is enough to
vault them from #17 last week to #5 this week.  Also the loss drops
Michigan a spot, making way for Notre Dame to move in to #2.  UGA still
leads the field after its commanding victory in the World's Largest Outdoor
Cocktail Party.
