title: college football poll - week 8
---

BYU remains in the #1 spot.  Interestingly, 4-1 Louisiana slides into
second place.  What's up with that?  Well, their one loss came to
undefeated Coastal Carolina.  And their four wins came against quality
opponents spread over three conferences: Georgia Southern and Georgia
State (Sun Belt), Iowa State (Big XII), and UAB (Conference USA).
This season, non-conference games are a rarity that skews the results
of the algorithm significantly.

Meanwhile, Big Ten play began yesterday as well.  Currently, all of
the 1-win B1G teams are tied for #34.  It will be interesting watching
some of them rise higher and higher as the season progresses.
