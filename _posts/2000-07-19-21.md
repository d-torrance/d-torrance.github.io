I have a blister on my blister! It all started when a little Celtic white boy decided he was going to get rid of the sock tan (a.k.a. space devoid of freckles in the ankle area), which matched so well with his watch and farmer tans, by running sans socks. Actually, not entirely sans socks, but sans enough sock that it caused two big ugly blisters to form, one over each Achilles tendon. Good ol' lefty healed right away, but the on right foot never went away, even causing this boy to stop running for over a week to let it heal. Finally, the time came, when the blister had become a mere scab. Alas, another blister formed underneath the scab. This time, he was wearing a complete sock. What could have caused this second blister? Was it the back and forth motion caused by running with a Band-Aid attempting to protect the scab? Perhaps it was just Fate playing a cruel trick on our antagonist. Whatever the case may be, I apologize for making you read about my foot. I am sorry.
