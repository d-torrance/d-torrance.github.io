A fixture on this site has often been the <a href="./comics.php">comics page</a>. While growing up, my morning routine normally included reading certain comics in the <a href="http://www.dispatch.com/">Columbus Dispatch</a> while eating my cereal before I went out to wait for the school bus. Despite my lack of Dispatch-ness in college, I eventually kept the tradition alive by programming first a Javascript and then a PHP page featuring a selection of my favorite toons. The current incarnation has actually been online longer than the current incarnation of this blog, but this is the first time I've ever actually linked to it. Sadly, some of my favorites, such as Zits, are unavailable. Somebody decided it would be a good idea to deny access to King Features cartoons from all but a select few servers. All you get is <a href="http://est.rbma.com/content/Zits?date=20060101">this obnoxious message</a>.
