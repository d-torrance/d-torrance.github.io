Ok, so I'm painting in the 90 degree heat today. I'm painting a fence. Do you know what this fence surrounds? A pool! Those things that are filled with water. Those things that make summer so fun. Those things that make you want to do a cannonball and splash around and pretend like you're 10 years old again. Yeah, you know what I'm talking about. And guess what? We didn't finish the fence! So that means more temptation tomorrow!!!! Whoooo!!!!!!!!!!!
