I was curious how the conferences stacked up with each other based on my ranking system. So I ranked them based on the average of their teams' rankings. For simplicity, the independents are treated as a conference. Here's the result, as of the week 7 poll:

<p/>
1 - Pacific-10 (29.9)<br/>
2 - Southeastern (36.5833333333333)<br/>
3 - Atlantic Coast (42.3333333333333)<br/>
4 - Big Ten (48.3636363636364)<br/>
5 - Big 12 (50.5833333333333)<br/>
6 - FBS Independent (55)<br/>
7 - Big East (55.125)<br/>
8 - Mountain West (72.1111111111111)<br/>
9 - Conference USA (75.0833333333333)<br/>
10 - Mid-American (82.3076923076923)<br/>
11 - Western Athletic (83.3333333333333)<br/>
12 - Sun Belt (93)

I was a little surprised with the Pac-10 rocking the top spot over the SEC. I guess that's what happens with Vandy stinking it up at \#107. And no love for the Big 12!
