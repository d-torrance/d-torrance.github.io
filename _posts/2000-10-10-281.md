I've found the one thing I like better about Windows 98 than Windows 2000 - CD Player. Win2K's CD Player's so obnoxious. I don't understand the appeal of windows that don't look like the rest of the windows that are open. Plus it lost all the functionality of the old CD Player. Although it does do the CDDB thing, that's it's one redeeming quality.
