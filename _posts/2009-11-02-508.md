title: college football poll - week 9
---

Argh, will the Washington effect never end? The 3-5 Huskies still haunt me at \#25. Despite a bye week, 'Bama's past victims did well enough to keep the Tide in the top spot. Oregon's domination of USC does enough to move the Ducks to \#2, and I finally give the Bearcats some love after they unseat . . . Syracuse? Oh, and the Gators and Longhorns, those teams everyone else has in the top two spots? Overrated!

The directed graph is now large enough (4.2 MB) that I'm getting server time-out errors when I attempt to upload it to ImageShack. So, uh, no more directed graphs.
