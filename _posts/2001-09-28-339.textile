Quote of the day:  <i>"Yeah. They think the British are a bunch of fucking heathens who eat greasy old toad in the hole, with mad cows and BSE and salmonella. They think that we eat slop, that our produce is crap, all our meat is fucked and that it rains all the time. Excuse me! It is all right for people to sit and take the piss out of me over here, but they should come and see what I do over there."</i> - <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/0107/07/entertainment/entertain4.html">Jamie Oliver</a>
