title: protected rivalries?
---

If the Big Ten splits East-West, I don't see any need for a protected cross-division rivalry game. All the big rivalries would already be in-division. What if we have another split? Then it becomes more necessary. Let's take my split from the <a href="/?id=532">last post</a>. It breaks down pretty well:

<p/>
Indiana-Illinois<br/>
Michigan State-Michigan<br/>
Nebraska-Iowa<br/>
Penn State-Ohio State<br/>
Purdue-Northwestern<br/>
Wisconsin-Minnesota
