title: double digits!
---

Well I did it. My first double-digit long run. Today's run was 11 miles. I tried a new route that went east of town on Darby Rd. and Olsen Rd., right in the shadow of Moscow Mountain. I thought the road names were especially cool because they happen to be the same as the names of my high school and a certain <i>Daily Planet</i> photographer who also happens to be Superman's pal. I'm really starting to feel like I've built up some good endurance - I just kept on trucking without really feeling tired.
