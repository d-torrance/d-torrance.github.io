Well, since <i>A Brave New World</i> has been completed, I must move on to another tale. I chose the Half Priced Book Store on Lane Avenue as my starting point. In the fifty cent clearance rack, I saw the first two installments of Isaac Asimov's <i>Foundation</i> trilogy. The cover proclaims the trilogy as the Hugo Award winner for best <i>all time</i> science fiction/fantasy series. Yes, that means it beat out <i>Lord of the Rings</i>. Undoubtedly, my expectations are high.
