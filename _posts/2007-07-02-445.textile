Today for my cross-training I decided to pay a visit to the exercise bikes at the <a href="http://www.campusrec.uidaho.edu/">Student Recreation Center</a>.  I'm pretty sure it's the first time I've been on one in 7 years.  The last time was when I was taking some classes at Ohio State over the summer and, wanting to reread the Lord of the Rings before the movies came out, decided to do the exercise bike thing instead of the running thing because it was a little more conducive to reading.  Except now I don't know if I could read on one of the bikes even if I wanted to - it kept screaming at me when I took my hands off these little sensor thingies that were monitoring my heart rate.  Pretty spiffy.
