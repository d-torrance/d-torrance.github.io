Today was my first 4-mile "easy run", which will mark Tuesdays and Thursdays for the next several weeks. The route is an out-and-back on the Paradise Path and Latah Trail. I'm not really sure where one ends and the other begins. The western boundary of the Paradise Path is pretty obvious, as there's this giant archway announcing that you're entering the Bill Chipman trail. But the eastern boundary is much more nebulous. According to the <a href="http://www.moscowchamber.com/ThingsToDo/Local_Recreation/Local_Recreation.htm">website</a>, the Paradise Path connects campus and downtown, implying that the Latah Trail begins in downtown. But, at least based on what I consider "downtown" to be, the trail goes nowhere near it! It jogs a good deal south. If I had to venture a guess, I'd say the trail changes names when it crosses US-95. Speaking of which, the fact that I have to wait at a light twice to cross US-95 during this route makes me consider finding another 4-mile route with less red light waiting time, and possibly less confusing trail name switches.
