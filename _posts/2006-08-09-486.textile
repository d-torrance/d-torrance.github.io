it took forever to find a place to spend the night that wasn't swarming with bikers. i'd hoped to stay in the rapid city area that night, but i ended up driving into wyoming. there were still tons of bikers at this campsite. in addition to the crowdedness, this site was also the lamest of the trip, as i had no fire ring and it was twice as expensive as the others. i did take a shower there, though, so that was a bonus.
