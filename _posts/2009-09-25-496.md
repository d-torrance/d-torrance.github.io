I redid the archives a bit. Rather than being accessed from a separate page, they're always accessible from the sidebar. Might as well use all that real estate on the right hand side, right?

I also noticed that my attempt at spam-blocking had been unsuccessful the other day. As a temporary fix, I had all comments from the offending entry (thanks, <a href="/?id=457">entry \#457!</a>) deleted every time the page was loaded. Now I think (hope, at least...) I've found a permanent fix.
