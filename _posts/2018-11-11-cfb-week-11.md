title: college football poll - week 11
---

A little motion at the top as Clemson/Alabama and Michigan/LSU each swap places.

Even though my Big Ten West Champion (!!!1!!!) Northwestern Wildcats don't crack into the poll (losing to Akron will do that to you...), Duke does.  And I'm sure the NU win over Iowa played a part in making that happen.
