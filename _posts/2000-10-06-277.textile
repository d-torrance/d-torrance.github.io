Today's date will go down in history.  Taking a break from aforementioned goose-infested math homework, I beat Eric at ping pong.  Yes, Eric, although I believe his full name is I Always Kick Doug's Ass in Ping Pong.  And I beat him fairly handily, too!  At one point I was up 20-11, although he scored five unanswered points I believe...  But hey, who came out on top in the end?  That's right.
