title: college football poll - week 5
---

So... Florida is \#1 in a gajillion polls. And they drop out of mine! I guess that's what happens after a bye week to a team who hasn't beaten anyone who currently has better than a .500 record.

<p/>
LSU returns to the top spot after taking down Georgia. Lots of love for the Pac-10 with four teams in the top 10. Notre Dame appears out of nowhere after their OT win against U-Dub. And ... my Idaho Vandals make their poll debut after a win over the Colorado State Rams on Saturday! I attended the game, a "Blackout" of the Kibbie Dome, where I was offered Jim Beam by strangers, possibly dislocated my thumb from applauding too much, and rushed the field afterwards, where I bumped into our starting QB and almost got tripped by a wire connected to an ESPNU camera.
