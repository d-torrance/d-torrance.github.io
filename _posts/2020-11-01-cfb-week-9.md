title: college football poll - week 9
---

The top few spots remain dominated by G5 teams who've actually had
non-conference games.  I'm guessing that it may be bowl season before
we see any of the usual suspects rise to the top, although the
winner of next week's Clemson/Notre Dame game may have a shot.

Meanwhile, the Big Ten is slowly but surely rising after their second
week of play.  WINdiana leads the pack, currently at #30.  Will any of
them break through into the Top 25 next week?

Also, Pac-12 play begins next week.  How long will it take for any of
those teams to appear?
