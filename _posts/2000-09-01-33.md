CHRISTINA AGUILERA STICKER UPDATE - I don't listen to her music. I can't say that I could even name one song that she sings. But I have a growing collection of stickers of this fine-looking young lady, purchased for 50 cents apiece in a vending machine at the local <a href="http://www.whitecastle.com">Whitey's</a>. Today I acquired my third sticker. Of the 15 in the collection, I now have \#6, 7 and 14. I will keep all of you updated with my progress.
