Wow, it's a beautiful day.  I think I'm going to find a nice quiet spot under a tree and read.  Not <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>.  I've decided that I'm sick of how Ayn Rand champions selfishness, and the only real reason I kept reading it was that I was interested in the subplot of Richard Halley, the composer.  If I want to read about composers, all I have to do is do my music history homework.  So my new book will be <i>Brave New World</i> by Aldous Huxley.  It is supposed to be one of the greatest science fiction books ever written, and it has the added bonus that I already own it.
