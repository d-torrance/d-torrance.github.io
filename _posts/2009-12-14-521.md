title: college basketball poll - week 5

Lots of movement, which is not surprising this early in the season. Yes, that's Kansas <i>State</i> in the number one spot, not the Jayhawks.

<p/>
A found a bug in my script where non-Division I games were getting counted. Massey's .csv files give these teams ID "0". It looks like my script had lumped all these team 0's together and treated them as one, which caused way more connections between teams than there should have been. That's been fixed.
