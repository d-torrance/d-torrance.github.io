Song stuck in my head while painting today: Fuel - Hemorrhage<br>
My computer is now running on an Antec 300W power supply, awaiting the arrival of my 1.4 GHz Athlon Thunderbird processor (mmmmmm....), possibly as early as tomorrow! The unfortunate thing is my case originally didn't have a spot for the plug thingie on the back of the power supply to peek through, so it took a shitload of filing to get things to the point where I could screw the damn thing in, but here I am now, happy as a clam. Well, not as happy as that other clam over there that already has <i>his</i> 1.4 GHz Athlon...<br>
MP3 of the day: Dido - Hunter
