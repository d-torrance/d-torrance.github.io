title: two steps forward, one step back
---

Today marked the end of my first "stepback" week. Basically, every third week, my long run will be significantly shorter than the previous week's, but the following weeks' will be the longest yet. So two weeks ago, I did 8 miles, last week I did 9, and this week I did 6. Next week I step up a bit more with 11. Fun fun! It was a beautiful evening - a great time to run!
