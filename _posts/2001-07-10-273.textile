You know, for "my" website, I certainly don't talk about "me" much.  If you're just someone randomly surfing on through, you might be like, "Whoa, some dude runs this thing?  Like an actual dude?  Wow!"  So anyways, maybe I'll talk about me for a bit.  For instance, what's Mr. Doug doing with himself this summer?  As far as employment, I'm painting houses with <a href="http://www.totalentropy.org">Matt</a>.  We're both complete comic book nerds, so we just talk about the Flash and paint.  And girls, gotta talk about girls.  When I'm not working, I'm probably reading aforementioned comic books or baking a pie.  I think I've averaged between 2 and 3 pies a week since I've gotten home from school.  This whole having my dad buy the ingredients thing is tight.  The current pie is pecan, one of my old classics.  The next pie will be another pecan pie.  Pecans always come in pairs due to how the ingredients come.  One bag of pecans makes 2 pies (even though I didn't get a normal bag this time, but rather a bag full of pecans from the bulk section, but anyways...), and one jar of corn syrup makes 2 pies.  So it's handy to make two pecan pies in a row.  Like twins.  Anyways, the next pie after that will be a chocolate cream pie, at the request of my dad.  Chocolate pie was my grandpa's favorite.  So that one'll be dedicated to him.
