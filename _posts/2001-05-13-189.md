My schedule next quarter will probably look something like this:

<div class="quote">
Wind\_per 313-0 Clarinet<br>
Math 310-1 Intro to Real Analysis<br>
Spanish 102-1 Intermediate Spanish<br>
Anthro 105-0 Fundamentals of Anthropology<br>
Wind\_per 391-0 Chamber Ensemble

</div>
The beauty of this is (depending on what time my Anthropology discussion section is) I might have absolutely no classes on Thursdays, and just one on Tuesdays, at 1 o'clock. Yay. :)
