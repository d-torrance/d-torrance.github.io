Back at school. Whoot. Well, I notice that many of my friends have put interesting quotes in their AOL Instant Messenger profiles, so I decided to add one of my favorite quotes to mine:

<p>
<b>Ray Stantz:</b><br>Gozer the Gozerian! Good evening! As a duly designated representative of the state, county and city of New York, I order you to cease any and all supernatural activity and return forthwith to your place of origin or to the nearest convenient parallel dimension!<br><b>Peter Venkman:</b><br>That ought to do it. Thanks very much, Ray.

<p>
And that ought to do it for me tonight. I'm pooped. Go sleep!
