So today was my big 12-miler.  Not 2 minutes into it, I tripped on my shoelace and found myself giving a very personal hello to A Street.  My knees got pretty scuffed up, but I managed to finish the run just fine.  I don't think I could have gone much further than the 12 miles - the last mile especially felt like I'd lost all actual energy and was running entirely on willpower - but that's all I needed to do for this week.  I've also decided to start posting some video blogs on YouTube - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sK3AqFYAWQ">check out the first one</a>.
