title: college football poll - week 2
---

Top 29 this week.  It turns out there was a bug in my code, so last week's poll may have been off.  Oh well.

Let's explore how one of our #1 teams got their 3.25 wins.  Auburn has beaten 2 teams head-to-head:  Oregon and Tulane.  That's 2 of their wins.  Oregon beat Neavada and Tulane beat Florida International, add a half a win each for Auburn, bringing their total up to 3.  Finally, Nevada beat Purdue, giving Auburn that last quarter win.
