title: college football poll - week 2
---

Top 35 this week.  It turns out there was a bug in my code, so last week's poll may have been off.  Oh well.

Let's explore how one of our #1 team got their 3.375 wins.  Auburn has beaten 2 teams head-to-head:  Oregon and Tulane.  That's 2 of their wins.  Oregon beat Nevada and Tulane beat Florida International, adding a half a win each for Auburn and bringing their total up to 3.  Finally, Nevada beat Purdue, giving Auburn a quarter win, and Purdue beat Vandy, giving them that last eighth of a win.
