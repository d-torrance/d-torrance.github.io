So today, seeing as the university pool is closed for remodeling and I don't really feel like spending 5 bucks to try and lap swim amidst swarms of kids at the Moscow pool, I did something I've always wanted to do - use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Dance_Revolution">Dance Dance Revolution</a> for cross-training.  After 40 minutes of DDRing, I worked up quite a sweat and my PS2 told me that I'd burned 250ish calories, or the equivalent of running 2.6 miles.  Not bad!  I'm not sure if I'll do this every Monday until the pool reopens  - I might try using some exercise machine at the university gym or even brave the Moscow pool  - but it's certainly a fun option!
