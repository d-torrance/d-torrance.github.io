title: college football poll - week 11

We had two big showdowns of unbeatens yesterday.  No surprise that LSU
maintains its top spot after thwarting the Crimson Tide's comeback attempt.
In the Big Ten, the Golden Gophers handed the Nittany Lions their first
loss, dropping Penn State from #2 to #5 and taking the #4 spot themselves.
Meanwhile, Ohio State slips into #2 ahead of Clemson.
