title: college football poll - week 6
---

The Fighting Irish remain in the top spot while the Clemson and LSU Tigers swap places after the latter's loss to previously unranked (and now #8) Florida.

Army's strange appearance last week was an aberration -- they've vanished from
the rankings.

Kentucky somehow goes *up* from #8 last week to #5 this week after its loss to
Texas A&M.
