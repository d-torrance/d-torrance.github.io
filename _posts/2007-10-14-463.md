Wow, it's been over a month since I've added an entry. I guess it makes sense, as over the last month I haven't really done much in the way of running. As the semester got a few weeks older, I found myself more and more bogged down in schoolwork with less time to run without sacrificing sleep. For a while, I found myself doubting my ability to actually finish a 26.2 mile race without some serious walking. So about a week ago I had the bright idea of switching my registration to the half-marathon, which was also occurring on the same day. That day was today. It was a great race. I started off faster than I expected, and to my surprise, I kept on going at about the same pace throughout, finishing in 1:57:43. I reached a sort of informal goal I'd had of breaking two hours. Realistically, I hadn't expected it considering the lack of running I'd done in the last few weeks. It was a beautiful race through a gorgeous city, and it's definitely helped to restore some of my lost motivation. For the future, I'm planning on running a couple 5-milers and 5Ks while I'm back in Ohio for the holidays, and shooting to finally take the 26.2 plunge either this spring in the Coeur d'Alene Marathon or next fall, location TBA based on which Ph.D. program I end up in.
