title: college football poll - week 12
---

No change in the top 3 from last week, but Minnesota drops down to #9
after losing to the Hawkeyes.  Interestingly, Auburn is still above Georgia
at #12 and #13, respectively, even after the Tigers were handed their third
loss of the season by the Dawgs.  That loss to South Carolina is really
keeping Georgia down -- I count three teams ahead of them in the poll that
they've beaten!

Notice that the virtual win totals are down from last week.  For
example, LSU dropped from nearly 53 to barely more than 40.  This is due to
the lack of FCS teams in the rankings now, mentioned in the last post.
