title: and so it actually begins
---

Well, today was the first day of honest-to-goodness running in my training program. Tuesdays and Thursdays will be my easy days, so it was only 3 miles. It was pretty chilly this morning (40s), but it was very clear and the sun sure made it feel like summertime by the end of my run. As far as route, I did my ol' standard 3-mile run. As luck would have it, I live exactly a mile and a half from the Washington state border, so it makes for a perfect "Washington and back" route on the <a href="http://www.pullmancivictrust.org/Chipman.html">Bill Chipman Trail</a>. There's a neat little sign at the border with "Vandals" (for UI) on one side and "Cougars" (for WSU) on the other. Also on Tuesdays, I do some strength training. Grad school must've atrophied my upper body muscles or something, because it takes all I've got to do a dozen pushups. I remember back in my marching band days, I'd crank them out like crazy. Oh well.
