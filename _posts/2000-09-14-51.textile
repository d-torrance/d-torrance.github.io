A disgustingly large portion of today was spent honing my FreeCell skillz.  I finally have a winning record!  458-457 as of right now!  Pitiful isn't it, over 900 games of FreeCell since I last reinstalled Windows, which was only like in June.  Today, I also got my best win streak.  Fifteen consecutive victories!  Pimpiddy pimp pimp pimp.  <a href="freecell.gif">Statistics</a>.
