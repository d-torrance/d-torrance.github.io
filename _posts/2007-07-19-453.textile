title: farewell, washington-and-back

*sniff*  Today was my last 3-miler until the week before the marathon.  Next week, my "easy runs" on Tuesday and Thursday get amped up to 4 miles.  So I said goodbye to the Bill Chipman Trail and will say hello next week to the Paradise Creek and Latah Trails, which make up the bulk of my 4-mile route.  *insert montage of fond memories running on the Chipman Trail and turning around at the state border, complete with sappy music*
