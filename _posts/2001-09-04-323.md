Happy Birthday, George!<br>
I decided to change the poll. Maybe I'll make it monthly? Anywho, it really hasn't changed all that much. Just gotten more specific. As far as results of the last poll, Jane and Harley Quinn tied with 6 votes each. One person actually wanted to bang Bugs. And, just like on the cartoon, no one wants one-eyed Leela... :(<br>
