Okay, now that I've cooled off a bit... I saw Robin Hood: Men in Tights for I think the second time tonight. I wanted to make a quote of the day from it, but since I lack the ability a large majority of the world's population seems to have in recalling word for word a funny line/scene from a favorite tv show/movie, and NO $![](#@%)$ WEBSITE SEEMS TO HAVE A MEN IN TIGHTS SCRIPT, you'll just have to put up with my probably completely incorrect recollection:<br>
Quote of the day: <i>"And I love you, Mrs. ... of Loxley"</i> - Robin Hood, <i>Robin Hood: Men in Tights</i><br>
No one'll probably get this but George, but hey, it makes me laugh, and this is my webpage, so poopy on you. :P
