title: college football poll - week 5
---
Notre Dame rises to the top after its win over Stanford, while LSU holds strong at #2 and Clemson comes in at the #3 spot after its QB drama-inducing game with Syracuse.

Nothing too surprising with this week's poll except #13 Army.  How did that happen?  Well, Army pwned last week's #5 team, Buffalo, with a score of 42-13.  Buffalo in turn has a win over Temple, which has a win over Maryland, which has wins over Texas and Maryland, giving Army a whole mess of indirects "wins".  Army's only losses are to still-undefeated Oklahoma and #15 Duke.  We'll see how long the Black Knights stick around.
