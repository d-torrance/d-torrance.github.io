D'oh -- the Army/Navy game is this weekend, so the regular college football season is not yet over!  I'll release one more poll, because it could have some effect.  For example, Iowa is just a nose above the Buckeyes right now.  OSU beat Navy.  So if the Midshipmen win (as they likely will), that could bump the Scarlet and Gray up a notch.  We shall see!

Oh, and what's the deal with spammers getting through my Turing test?  Argh.
