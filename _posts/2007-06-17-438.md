title: one week down, 17 to go
---

My first official week of marathon training is over, as is my first official long run. Although I've done plenty of Sunday long runs this spring leading up to this, this was my longest of 2007: 8 miles. I took a route that headed a good deal north of Moscow, through the beautiful rolling hills and wheatfields of the Palouse. For a while, the wind was pretty strong, and it was blowing the grain so that it looked liked waves on a green ocean. It was also my first run in my new high-tech sweat-wicking running shirt I bought yesterday. Overall, it was a great session. I felt strong all the way through, and even felt like I could've gone a few miles more. I don't know about another 18.2, but I've got plenty of time to work up to that!
