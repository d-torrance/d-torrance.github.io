I'm sitting in the <a href="http://www.library.nwu.edu">library</a> today, doing some <a href="http://math.nwu.edu">math</a>, when all of a sudden, I hear the ring of a cell phone. This girl answers the phone, then proceeds to tell the caller, "I can't talk because each minute costs me forty <a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/">cents</a>." Two things bother me about this. First, wouldn't a much more valid excuse be, "I can't talk because I'm sitting the library and some of us are trying to do some math?" And second, <i>why on Earth would you buy a cell phone only to never use it because it costs too much???</i>
