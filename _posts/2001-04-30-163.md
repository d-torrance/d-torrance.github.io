It's a weird phenomenon. Even though I'm probably a good 4 years older than the older brother Peter from <a href="http://www.foxtrot.com">Fox Trot</a>, when I read it, it still feels like he's older than me. And Paige, the middle sister, seems older than me. When reading Fox Trot, I still identify the most with 10-year-old Jason. It's a cool thing, being magically transported back 10 years for 30 seconds every day. Yay.
