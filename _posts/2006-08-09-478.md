<b>day 3</b> - i swear i took a picture of my camp outside of sioux falls, but i guess it didn't develop. anywho, this is the apparently world famous corn palace in mitchell, sd. the lady at aaa told me about it so i figured i'd stop and take a picture. i got here before it opened, although i wouldn't have gone inside even if it were.
