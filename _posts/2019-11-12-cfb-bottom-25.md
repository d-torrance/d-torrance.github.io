title: college football poll - bottom 25
---

I made a couple updates to the poll code.  I was curious who the
*bottom* 25 teams would be, and in particular how far my Northwestern Wildcats
had fallen after winning the Big Ten West last year.  So I added an option
to reverse the ranking.

To facilitate this, I removed FCS teams from the equation, which is how
it originally was back in the Perl days.  Otherwise, an FCS team which lost
to a bad FBS team might appear in this ranking, even though only one of its
games was taken into consideration.

So here it is, the worst 25 FBS teams.  The 'Cats come in at #17.  Potential
good news for them -- the play the #3 Massachusetts Minutemen on Saturday!
