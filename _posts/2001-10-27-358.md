So I had this dream a few days ago. I'm making this pan of scalloped oysters, my dad's favorite Christmas Eve dish, which I can't stand, which is quite odd since normally I fall in love with just about anything that passes as something halfway similar to food. So after the oysters have finished baking, the pan grows to enormous proportions and becomes a big room with two big king-sized beds made out of breaded oysters. And I don't recall exactly, but I think I got some sweet lovin' on one of these oyster beds from some random girl I had a crush on in middle school or something, since that sort of thing tends to happen in my dreams.<br>
I like my subconscious mind's view of reality better than my conscious mind's.
