I finished <i>A Brave New World</i> last night.  Tight book.  My quote of the day is:
<div class="quote">
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I don't want comfort.  I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness.  I want sin."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In fact," said Mustapha Mond, "you're claiming the right to be unhappy."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"All right then," said the Savage defiantly, "I'm claiming the right to be unhappy."</i>
