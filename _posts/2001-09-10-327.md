Built to Spill was freaking amazing. I was standing right in the center, four people back from the front. They closed with Freebird by Skynyrd! That was loads of fun. Freaking amazing.<br>
Funny thing, though. I get to the Newport Music Hall, and the marquee says Built <i>For</i> Spill is playing...<br>
