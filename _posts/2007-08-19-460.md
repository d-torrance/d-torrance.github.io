title: rain, rain, go away
---

After a summer of dry, sunny days in which to run, the Palouse greeted my first 17-miler this morning with a steady, miserable downpour. Bleh. At least it kept me cool, I guess. Today's run took me from Moscow to Pullman and back again, mostly along the Bill Chipman Trail, which previously I had only used for my "Washington-and-back" 3-milers. I think I started out the first few miles a tad fast - some pushed 9-minute pace - as the last few were tortoise speed. I was incredibly tired towards the end. I think the only thing keeping me from stopping to walk was the fact that doing so would have required even more time spent in the rain.
