Well, I'm not playing any April Fool's jokes. How boring, huh? Hmm, I could pretend like I was hacked or something like every other site out there... The only pimp one I've seen is <a href="http://www.google.com">google.com</a>. Pretty damn funny if you ask me. I wonder how many people fell for it. I'm sure I would've if I hadn't been told about it beforehand on IRC. Just like I fell for that "Your monitor can take your picture!!" crap and you get the monkey. :P Yeah, I know--I'm dumb.

Well, anyways, I finally got Apache working in Linux. Pretty pimp, huh? This is running off of my puter. Well, that is if you're reading it at profzoom.dhs.org, that is. If you're reading it at pubweb.nwu.edu, then it's not. :P Hmmm. I probably should keep you guys happy with something funny or some crap like that right? Well fine. Let me go look for something. Be back in a few... Although actually to you, it'll be immediately cause this is all in the past. Sheesh.

Alright, back. Somethingawful.com's always a good place to go for some yucks. (Er, yuks I suppose, you know, in the laughing sense, not yucks like goatse.cx or anything which I'm not going to a href cause it's just downright nasty.) So here we go: <a href="http://www.somethingawful.com/spam/icq-nate-01.htm">this</a>. It's pretty darn funny. Alright, well I might go to bed soon. I dunno. It's 3:30 AM. Good ol' late night dicking around in Linux. Whoot. Damn, I tend to ramble a lot in these wee hours.
