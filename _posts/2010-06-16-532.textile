title: big ten divisions - the historic way
---
So I wrote my perl script in such a way that it would be easy to recalculate things with new data, i.e., anything other than my friedcheese.org rankings.  Let's use historical winning percentage, since everyone seems so gung ho about that when they argue for splitting up the Michigan/Ohio State/Penn State triumvirate.
<p/>
Using figures from <a href="http://football.stassen.com/records/">http://football.stassen.com/records/</a>, we get:
<p/>
<i>East</i><br>
Indiana, Michigan State, Nebraska, Penn State, Purdue, Wisconsin
<p/>
<i>West</i><br>
Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Northwestern,  Ohio State
<p/>
Both divisions rock an average winning percentage of .584.  This is less geographic than before, trading the Big Two for Nebraska and Wisconsin.  A pure geographic breakdown gives a winning percentage of .615 in the east and .554 in the west.
