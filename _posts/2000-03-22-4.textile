Well, I'm out of old websites I made in high school on Geocities to share with you folks.  Bummer.  Guess what, everyone?  I'm finally starting on the Mozart concerto!  Whoohoo!  Yep, that's my fun fact for the day.  Bad news I need to have it ready to perform by April 10, and that's only if it's cool with Mr. Dagon that I play it.  So I gots to hustle.  Oh, another pimp thing to mention--George and I ate at Whitey's for the first time since Christmas break.  So that was pimp.  Pimp pimp pimp.  Go Whitey's!
<p>
(Translation for those of you who may not know George and me:  Whitey's = White Castle.  Mmmm mmm good!)
