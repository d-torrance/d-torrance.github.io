Whoo!  After a long Linux-less drought, I've returned to my former l33tishness.  After unsuccesfully attempting to get Gnome to work with Debian, and unsuccesfully getting my computer to even boot with RedHat, here I am with Mandrake.  I like it.<br>
The quote of the day was gonna be an excerpt from an IM conversation with Jen about male-to-female ratios at college and guys at schools like hers with a 1-to-10 ratio having little harems, but I was using AOL's ghetto Java client and lost everything before I thought to copy it down.<br>
MP3 of the day:  The Smashing Pumpkins - The Aeroplane Flies High (Turns Left, Looks Right)
