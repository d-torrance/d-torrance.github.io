title: and so it begins
---
Today marked the start of my 18-week marathon training program.  It began, rather anticlimactically, without any running at all.  Rather, Monday will be my cross-training days, and so I headed to the university aquatic center for some lap swimming.  Besides my practice swim last Monday, I haven't done any serious swimming since I was taking lessons over a decade ago.  However, I felt pretty good.  I did 20 laps total, 5 freestyle, 5 breaststroke, 5 backstroke, and 5 more freestyle.  Let's hope my arms don't feel like jelly all this week like they did last...
