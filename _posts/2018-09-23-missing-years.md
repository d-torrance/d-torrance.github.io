With the return of the friedcheese.org, let's see what happened during the
missing years...

2017
----
Last year's friedcheese.org national champions were ... the Memphis Tigers?
They went 10-3 and won the AAC West.  Two of those losses were to undefeated
UCF, so that helped.  But still, a real head-scratcher.

My Northwestern Wildcats came in at #24, though!
