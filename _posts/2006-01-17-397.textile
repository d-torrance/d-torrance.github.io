Archive is up and running.  The major improvement over the previous version is that links to months (or in the case of 2005, years) which contain zero entries no longer exist.  Also, the archive is merely an if statement within index.php, not its own separate page.  Perhaps sometime I'll mess around with some nifty CSS or Javascript expandable/collapsible menus or somesuch.
