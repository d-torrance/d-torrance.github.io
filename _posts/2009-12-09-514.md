title: college basketball poll - week 4
---

Unfortunately, the NCAA statistics website isn't consistent between all the various sports, and while I can get a nice Perl-ready .csv of all the Division I-A football scores this season, no such .csv exists for Division I men's basketball. There's a .pdf, but I didn't really feel like dealing with that. I'm sure it's possible, since Perl is amazing and everything, but whatever. So, instead, I'm getting my basketball scores from <a href="http://www.masseyratings.com/">Massey Ratings</a>.

<p/>
Other than that, the formula is the same as my football poll, <a href="/?id=465">explained here</a>. I don't really have any commentary, as I haven't quite left college football mode yet. So here it is:

<p/>
1 - Duke (7-1) (53.02734375) <br/>
2 - Purdue (7-0) (52.19921875) <br/>
3 - Syracuse (8-0) (48.59375) <br/>
4 - Villanova (8-0) (47.26806640625) <br/>
5 - Connecticut (6-1) (45.6640625) <br/>
6 - William & Mary (6-2) (44.92529296875) <br/>
7 - Kansas St (7-1) (44.45458984375) <br/>
8 - Wisconsin (6-1) (43.796875) <br/>
9 - Kentucky (8-0) (43.5390625) <br/>
10 - Vanderbilt (6-1) (42.985107421875) <br/>
11 - Florida (8-0) (42.16796875) <br/>
12 - West Virginia (5-0) (42.1640625) <br/>
13 - North Carolina (7-2) (42.0546875) <br/>
14 - Missouri St (7-0) (41.4715576171875) <br/>
15 - Mississippi (7-1) (40.967529296875) <br/>
16 - Ohio St (7-1) (40.7557373046875) <br/>
17 - New Mexico (8-0) (39.6673278808594) <br/>
18 - Harvard (6-2) (39.54296875) <br/>
19 - Texas Tech (8-0) (39.326171875) <br/>
20 - Gonzaga (6-2) (38.8046875) <br/>
21 - Texas A&M (7-1) (38.63330078125) <br/>
22 - Washington (6-1) (38.61328125) <br/>
23 - Notre Dame (8-1) (38.50341796875) <br/>
24 - Clemson (7-2) (38.21875) <br/>
25 - Miami FL (8-1) (38.0859375)

<p/>
I'm not going to bother with directed graphs since there's like 300 Division I teams.
