title: college football poll - week 4
---
Sad face.  My 'Cats dropped out this week.  Since South Dakota is an FCS team, their win doesn't count.  And 'Cuse, Vandy, and BC keep losing their FBS games, which isn't helping either...<p/>
Anyway, Notre Dame's win over Michigan causes them to swap places with Stanford.  And how about two-win Oregon State in fourth place?  When those two wins are over Wisconsin and 
week 2 number one UCLA, that will happen.<p/>
