Looks like Timmy-Wimmy lucked out and got <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/news/1999/0906/41369.html">signed by the Bills</a> as a free agent.  And of course they have to mention, <i>"He is also engaged to Survivor TV show contestant Elisabeth Filarski."</i>  JUST RUB IT IN A LITTLE MORE, WHY DON'T YA??  But, no, seriously, I'm happy for her.  Yep.
