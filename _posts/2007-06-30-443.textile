So according to my buddy <a href="http://www.halhigdon.com">Hal</a>, every other Saturday or so I'm supposed to run at "race pace".  Well, not having ever run a marathon before, I'm not entirely sure what my race pace will be.  I've been kind of thinking I'd like to shoot for just under 4 hours, since that seems like a nice round, and respectable, time.  So that works out to a tad over 9 minutes a mile.  So today, I started out my 5 mile run thinking, alright, let's shoot for that 9 minute mile pace.  Well, my internal pace-o-meter must've been broken since my first mile was a 7:45!  Whoops.  I managed to slow it down a bit, finishing the run in 42:30, which is an average 8:30 pace.  So still a bit quick!
