title: as big as your head!

Ever since I was probably in high school, I've had this big plastic cup I got at <a href="http://www.labambaburritos.com/">La Bamba</a>.  In college, I started keeping it in my bedroom and filling it up with water to keep myself hydrated while i studied/gamed/etc.  Well sad news.  It has this big ol' split in the side and it starts dripping all over the place when I fill it up.  I figure I probably stepped on it while stumbling to turn off my alarm one morning.  Sadly, it's time to retire The La Bamba Cup.
