title: college football poll - week 11
---

I don't think anyone is going to touch BYU as long as they keep winning, at
least until bowl season.

I did a little analyzing of the data, and there are currently *six* different
components of our graph:

* ACC, Big 12, and non-MAC G5 conferences.  This component has 75 teams,
  which is why the poll is currently so skewed toward this group.
* SEC
* Big Ten
* MAC
* There are *two* Pac-12 groups!  So far, the Arizona schools and USC
  have only played each other, so they're still separated from the
  rest of the conference.
