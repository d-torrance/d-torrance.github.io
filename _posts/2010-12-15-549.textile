title: college football poll - week 15
---
Final regular season poll.  Since this week's only game was Army v. Navy, there naturally weren't many (read: any) changes.
<p/>
Interesting that, by my poll, the MNC game will be a #5 v. #12 match-up.  Because of this, I'm thinking of perhaps adjusting my algorithm.  Instead of just based on theoretical wins, it will be also be based on theoretical losses.  That would (hopefully) prevent teams with several losses from creeping high into the rankings, which often happens.  A crappy Washington team last year that stayed ranked for what seemed like forever and the low ranking of Oregon this year are perfect examples of my system's flaws.
