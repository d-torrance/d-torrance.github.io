Well, I've got a Geek Code as of yesterday. What else do I need to truly have a geek webpage? Aha! My <a href="screen.jpg">Linux screenshot</a>!!! I'm running WindowMaker with a predominantly red theme I designed in Gimp and of course the pic of Jen and me in the background. :) Yeah, I know, it's only 800x600. I've only got a 15-inch monitor. But I like it that way. For one thing, my desk in my dorm room is cramped enough already, and I'm used to 15-inchers. Whenever I use a 17-inch, it feels so big. Ick.

<p>
Oh poo. I realized that I deleted the April Fool's Day Part Deux news item. It's all cause I mirror this page at my pubweb account. Maybe I won't do that anymore. Keep my personal page running off my box and just leave the pubweb account with my Flash and calc pages or something. But my box isn't on all the time. But who even goes to my page? Has anyone ever even been here? The only link I know to it is the squirrel.avi from <a href="http://pubweb.nwu.edu/~adm641">Andrew</a>'s page. And I don't even have the actual movie anymore--it's just a text file with a little message. **evil snicker** So yeah, whatever. Hmm, maybe I should incorporate more than one html file at some point. Or I could just keep adding to this, until it's like many many megs. Hehe. Okay,Nwhatever. Maybe I should get some sleep or something.
