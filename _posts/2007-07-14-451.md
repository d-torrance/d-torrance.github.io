Today's run was another 6-miler, and, thankfully, happened to be one of the occasional Saturdays which didn't call for "race pace". I did my usual route, the "Kibbie/sheep run", which, surprisingly enough, goes behind the Kibbie Dome and through the university's sheep farm. (My buddies weren't out eating today...) Almost every time I do this, or similar, runs, I see a few birds running around on the road just north of the sheep farm. At first, I thought they must be roadrunners. I mean, they are running on a road - and they're pretty good at it I might add - the little buggers are faster than me! They even have a little tuft of feathers on their heads that look like they might have inspired a cartoon version on Wile E. Coyote's nemesis. But alas, Wikipedia tells me that the Greater Roadrunner is exclusive to the <i>south</i>west, not the northwest. It's probably just some Idaho species of sparrow taunting me.
