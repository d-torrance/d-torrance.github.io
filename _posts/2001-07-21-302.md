I believe I have thoroughly disgusted anyone who might have visited my site seeing as Eric and I are the only souls brave enough to take the plunge and add our votes to the poll. That or the rest of you are using Netscape 4 and the CSS isn't getting rendered correctly. Either way, all I know is that I'm really tired caused I painted for 11 hours today. Yes, eleven hours of painting on a Saturday. I'm a masochist. Since I painted so long, more than one song was stuck in my head. Unfortunately, one of these was Limp Bizkit again. Goddamnit. Fred Durst needs to rot in H-E-double-hockey-sticks for getting that doggone crap stuck in my noggin. Among the other songs were some Metallica, Mousse T., Beatles, and one of those really crappy poppy rock songs that came out around senior year in high school. Maybe not BNL, but something along those lines. I'm probably gonna crash pretty soon here. Dead tired. Whoo.
