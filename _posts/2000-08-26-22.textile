Someday, in the maybe distant future, I'm gonna go and shell out my 35 bucks for friedcheese.org.  But until then, you're stuck with a psuedo-friedcheese.org here at nwu.edu.  So here's my current idea for the look.  Similar colors to how my page has always looked, but a little different.  Logo by moi with Paint Shop Pro.  Eventually, this site'll be run by mysql and php or perl (which should I do?  php is like the new hot thing, but perl is so l33t - i dunno).  But for now, it's just me slaving over old fashioned html.
