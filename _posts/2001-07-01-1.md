Hello! Welcome to the new server! George's computer's apparently behind a firewall or has a private IP or something, so only he could access it... So anyways, I actually am shelling out ten bucks a month to the good people at <a href="http://www.phpwebhosting.com">phpwebhosting.com</a> for this space. Hopefully all will be pimp. Unfortunately transferring all my old entries is being a butt. I'm hoping to sort that out once I have telnet access.
